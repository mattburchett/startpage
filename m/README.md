MattBurchett.com / StartPage (Mobile Edition)
=============

I have forked the JupiterColony.com repository from Rikai. I am putting my own spin on things, and making it my own as a landing page for myself at MattBurchett.com.

MattBurchett.com / Startpage (Mobile Edition)--

The startpage will have a Opera Speed-dial style layout for use as a new-tab page / home page. It will have set quick access links, and searching via DuckDuckGo and Google.

Main Change between the Desktop and Mobile Edition is the DuckDuckGo seach box, it makes the website have to scroll. The rest of the page renders perfectly.
